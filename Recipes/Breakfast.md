## Oatmeal Muffins

![OatmealMuffins](./assets/OatmealMuffins.png)

For an oatmeal muffin that is packed with oats but also has a fine, tender texture, we processed old-fashioned rolled oats into a flour in the food processor. To boost oat flavor, we first toasted the oats in a couple of tablespoons of butter and eliminated extraneous spices from the batter. To ensure a lump-free batter, we used a whisk to fold the wet and dry ingredients together and allow the batter to sit and hydrate for 20 minutes before baking. Finally, we made an apple crisp-inspired topping of crunchy oats, nuts, and brown sugar.

### Ingredients
*Makes 12 Muffins*

#### Topping
---:|
	42|g|		Rolled oats
	47|g|		Plain flour
	1/3 |cup|	Pecans / Walnuts chopped fine
	66|g|		Raw castor sugar
	1 |tsp|	Cinnamon
	1/8 |tsp|	Salt
	55|g|		Melted butter

#### Muffins
---:|
	30|g|		Butter
	85|g|		Melted butter
	170|g|	Rolled Oats
	250|g|	Self-raising flour
	1 ½ |tsp| Salt
	265|g|	Raw castor sugar
	355|mL|	Milk
	2	||	Eggs, beaten

### Method
1. FOR THE TOPPING: Combine oats, flour, pecans, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in medium bowl. 
2. Drizzle melted butter over mixture and stir to ­thoroughly combine; set aside.
3. FOR THE MUFFINS: Grease and flour 12-cup muffin tin. 
4. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add oats and cook, stirring frequently, until oats turn golden brown and smell of cooking popcorn, 6 to 8 minutes. 
5. Transfer oats to food processor and process into fine meal, about 30 seconds. 
6. Add flour, and salt to oats and pulse until combined, about 3 pulses.
7. Stir 6 tablespoons melted butter and sugar together in large bowl until smooth. 
8. Add milk and eggs and whisk until smooth. 
9. Using whisk, gently fold half of oat mixture into wet ingredients, tapping whisk against side of bowl to release clumps. Add remaining oat mixture and continue to fold with whisk until no streaks of flour remain. 
10. Set aside batter for 20 minutes to thicken. 
11. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 190 degrees.
12. Using ice cream scoop or large spoon, divide batter equally among prepared muffin cups (about ½ cup batter per cup; cups will be filled to rim). 
13. Evenly sprinkle topping over muffins (about 2 tablespoons per muffin). 
14. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 18 to 25 minutes, rotating muffin tin halfway through baking.
15. Let muffins cool in muffin tin on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove muffins from muffin tin and serve or let cool completely before serving.
