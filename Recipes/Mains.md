## Chinese Braised Beef 

![Chinese Braised Beef](./assets/ChineseBraisedBeef.png)

With its generous amount of soy sauce, this dish is meant to taste salty, which is why we pair it with plain white rice (see related content). A simple steamed vegetable like bok choy or broccoli completes the meal. Boneless beef short ribs require little trimming, but you can also use a 4-pound chuck roast. Trim the roast of large pieces of fat and sinew, cut it across the grain into 1-inch-thick slabs, and cut the slabs into 4 by 2-inch pieces.

### Ingredients
---:|
	1 1/2 |tbsp|| 	unflavoured gelatine   
	2 1/2 |cups| |	water  
	1/2 |cup|| dry sherry  
	1/3 |cup|| 	soy sauce  
	2 |tbsp|| 		hoisin sauce  
	2 |tbsp| |		molasses  
	2 |in|| piece ginger peeled,	and crushed   
	4 |cloves||		garlic peeled and smashed   
	1 1/2 |tsp|| 	five-spice powder   
	1 |tsp|| 		red pepper flakes   
	1.3 |kg|| 	boneless beef short ribs, trimmed and cut into 4-inch lengths   
	1 |tsp| |		cornstarch 

### Method 
1. Sprinkle gelatin over 2 1/2 cups water in Dutch oven and let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. 
2. Heat softened gelatin over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sherry, soy sauce, hoisin, molasses, scallion whites, ginger, garlic, five-spice powder, and pepper flakes. Stir in beef and bring to simmer. Remove pot from heat. Cover tightly with sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, then lid. Transfer to oven and cook until beef is tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stirring halfway through cooking. 
3. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to cutting board. Strain sauce through fine-mesh strainer into fat separator. Wipe out pot with paper towels. Let liquid settle for 5 minutes, then return defatted liquid to now-empty pot. Cook liquid over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced to 1 cup, 20 to 25 minutes. 
4. While sauce reduces, using 2 forks, break beef into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Whisk cornstarch and remaining 1 tablespoon water together in small bowl. 
5. Reduce heat to medium-low, whisk cornstarch mixture into reduced sauce, and cook until sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Return beef to sauce and stir to coat. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is heated through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle scallion greens over top. Serve.

### Method
1. Pre-heat the oven to 180 C.
2. Toast the spices for the brine in the oven for 10 minutes, then blitz in a spice grinder or food processor to a coarse powder. Tie them in a muslin parcel with the zest, herbs and garlic.
3. Combine 1kg cold tap water and the salt in a large saucepan, add the muslin parcel and bring to the boil over a medium heat.
4. Using a very sharp knife, carefully remove the top skin of the pork belly, trying to keep it intact. Wrap the skin in clingfilm and keep in the fridge.
5. Remove the brine from the heat, pour into a bowl and allow to cool completely. Discard the spice bundle. Place  the pork belly in the liquid, cover with clingfiIm and place in the fridge for 12 hours.
6. After 12 hours, remove the meat from the brine and soak in cold water for 1 hour, changing the water every 15 minutes. When  ready to braise the pork, preheat the oven to 70 C.
7. Place the brined pork in a large casserole with a lid, then add the vegetables and pour over the stock. Cover and cook over a medium heat until the liquid begins to simmer, then place in the Oven for 18 hours.
8. After 13 hours, put the unwrapped pork skin on a drying rack on top of a baking tray and place in the oven while the pork is slow cooking.
9. After 18 hours, remove the casserole dish and pork skin from the oven and increase the heat to 240 C.
10. Allow the braised pork to cool in the liquid. Once cool, remove the pork and set aside. Strain the liquid into a pan, discarding the vegetables.
11. Return the pork skin to the hot oven and cook for approximately 15 minutes until the skin has puffed up.
12. Set aside approximately 200g of the strained stock. Place the rest in a pan over a high heat and reduce by two-thirds. Season and keep warm.
13. When ready to eat, heat the 200g stock in a pan over a medium heat and add the pork belly, skinned-side up, being careful not to get the top wet. When warmed through (after approximately 20 minutes), remove the pork from the liquid and drain on kitchen paper.
14. Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan until smoking hot then place the pork belly, skinned-side down, in the pan and allow to colour for 30 seconds.
15. Combine the reduced stock with the liquid left over from warming the pork. Serve the pork in thick slices with mashed potato, sauce and a piece of the crispy skin.

<a name="PizzaBase"></a>
## Pizza Base

Makes 2 pizza bases

### Ingredients
---|
	1 ¾ |cup	|Water
	7g||			Dry Yeast
	1 |tbsp|		Sugar
	2 |tbsp	|	Olive Oil
	4 |cups|		Flour
	1 ½ |tsp|	Salt

### Method
1. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with either metal or plastic blade, add water and sprinkle in yeast and sugar
2. Pulse twice to dissolve yeast.
3. Add all remaining ingredients and process until mixture forms cohesive mass. Dough should not be sticky (if it is, add 2 more tablespoons flour and pulse briefly) nor should it be dry and crumbly (if it is, add 1 more tablespoons water and pulse briefly).
4. Remove dough from food processor and knead by hand on floured work surface for 1 minute or until dough is smooth and satiny (dough will feel a bit tough at this point).
5. Very lightly oil large bowl with vegetable oil or cooking spray. Place dough in bowl (do not coat dough with oil) and cover with plastic wrap. Place in warm oven. Let rise for 40 minutes or until doubled.
6. Remove from bowl, punch down, and separate into two round pieces.
7. Let rest for 10 minutes under damp dish towel
8. Flatten the dough into a disk using the palm of your hand.  
![](./assets/PizzaBase1.png)  
9. Starting at the center and working outward, use your fingertips to press the disk to about 1/4-inch thick.  
![](./assets/PizzaBase2.png)  
10. Using one hand to hold the dough in place, use your other hand to stretch the dough outward. For a medium-thick pizza crust, repeat the stretching by turning the dough a quarter turn after each pull, until it is the correct diameter. For a thinner pizza, let the dough relax for 5 minutes, then continue stretching it until it has reached the correct diameter.

<a name="ChickenandHamPie"></a>
## Chicken and Ham Pie

![](./assets/ChickenandHamPie.jpg)

When the ingredients for a pie are cooked together for a long time, the textures and flavours tend to become bland and amorphous. Here the main components of the dish are cooked separately and bought together only right at the end.  This helps preserve the character and integrity of each ingredient.

To intensify the flavour, the chicken is placed in a brine (p. 135) and left for 5 hours, during which time you can carry on with other parts of the recipe. Two hours after the chicken goes into the brine, pre-heat the oven for the ham. After the ham has been cooking for 3 hours, you prepare the chicken and place it in the oven as well.

I really like the flavour of cooked chicken skin, but in a pie, where it’s not crisped up, it can be tough and chewy. So here the skin is removed from the chicken, rendered in a pan, and the fat is then used to soften the leeks, so you still capture that lovely chicken-skin flavour.

This pie filling is thickened using agent agar-agar, rather than a starch. But if you can't get agar-agar, use cornflour — it’ll still be very tasty. This recipe will make six individual pies, but if you prefer make a large one to serve family-style.

### Ingredients
*Serves 6*

#### For the chicken

	8%	Brine (80g salt dissolved in 1kg tap water)
	8	Boned and skinned chicken thighs (keep thw skin)
	500g Brown chicken stock (p.39)

#### For the ham

	Gammon joint, weighing approx. 1 kg
	Onion, peeled and finely sliced
	Leek, white part only, cleaned and finely sliced
	Carrot, peeled and finely sliced

#### For the leeks

	2 tbsp	Groundnut or grapeseed oil
	Chicken skin  from the thighs
	300g	Leeks, white part only, 
			cleaned and finely sliced

#### For the mustard sauce

	200g 	White wine
	225g 	Whole milk
	225g 	Double cream
	150g 	Brown chicken stock (from above)
	2 tbsp 	Agar-agar flakes (Specialist ingredients. p.394
	30g 	Dijon mustard
	40g 	Wholegrain mustard
			Salt and black pepper

#### To assemble and cook the pies

	5g 		Tarragon leaves
	10g 	Flat-leaf parsley
	250g 	All-butter puff pastry
	1 		Medium egg, lightly beaten

### Method
1. Place the brine in a bowl big enough to contain the chicken thighs. Add the chicken and leave for S hours.
2. Rinse the chicken under cold running water for S minutes, then dry with kitchen roll. Store in the fridge until needed.
3. Two hours after you have started brining the chicken, pre-heat the oven to 85 C.
4. Put the gammon joint and vegetables in an ovenproof saucepan, and pour in enough cold water to cover the meat. Put a lid on the pan and place over a medium heat.
5. Bring the water to a simmer and then place the pan in the oven for 5 hours, or until the meat flakes. Allow the meat to cool in the liquid before removing and dicing.
6.  When the gammon has been cooking for 3 hours place the brined chicken thighs in another ovenproof saucepan and cover with the chicken stock. Bring the stock to a simmer over a medium heat, then place in the oven along with the ham, for 1 hour 30 minutes.
7. Allow the chicken to cool in the liquid before removing and dicing. Keep 150g of the chicken stock for the mustard sauce that will bind the pies. (The remaining stock can be used for soups or sauces, or discarded.) 
8. Allow the chicken to cool in the liquid before removing and dicing. Keep 150g of the chicken stock for the mustard sauce that will bind the pies. (The remaining stock can be used for soups or sauces, or discarded.)
9. Meanwhile, cook the leeks. Coat the bottom of a frying pan with the oil and place the pan over a medium-high heat. Add the chicken skin and render the fat from it for 10-15 minutes. Remove the skin and discard.
10. Reduce the heat to medium and add the leeks to the fat. Cook until completely soft (approx. 15 minutes), then allow to cool in the pan.
11. Now make the mustard sauce. In the saucepan, reduce the white wine by two-thirds. Add the milk, cream and chicken stock and cook for 10 minutes over a low heat while whisking. Sprinkle the agar-agar into the pan and whisk it into the sauce. Continue to simmer for 4 minutes. Allow to cool, then blitz thoroughly with a hand blender. Return the pan to a medium heat, stir in the Dijon and wholegrain mustards, and season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
12. When ready to assemble and cook the pies, pre-heat the oven to 215 C.
13. Mix the diced ham and chicken with the mustard sauce and leeks. Finely chop the herbs, add them to the mixture and adjust the seasoning. Pour into individual pie dishes, approximately 10cm in diameter or, if you prefer, a family sized dish, approximately 28cm in length).
14. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface until approximately 5mm thick. Cut out six circles slightly larger than the diameter of the pie dishes (or cut to the right size for a single pie). Leave the pastry in the fridge to rest for about 20 minutes.
15. Lay the pastry discs over the pie dishes and fold the overhang around the lip of the each dish to seal the edges.
16. Crimp the edges of the pies with a fork for decoration. Make a few holes in the middle to release the steam. Using a pastry top of the pies with the beaten egg.
17. Place in the oven for approx. 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is golden on top. (A large pie will take longer to heat through)

## Cast Iron Steaks with Herb Butter {#CastIronSteak}

To pan-sear a thick-cut steak, we turned to a cast-iron skillet since its heat-retention properties are ideal for a perfect sear. We chose the moderately expensive boneless strip steak for its big, beefy flavor. But when we tried preheating the skillet on the stovetop, cast iron’s uneven heat distribution properties created an equally uneven sear on our steaks. As a result, we ended up preheating the skillet in the oven. To get a perfectly even sear, we used quite a large amount (2 tablespoons) of oil, since this meant that the steaks’ surfaces remained in contact with the heat even as the steaks unevenly contracted during cooking. We started out flipping our steaks only once, halfway through cooking. But we found that flipping the steaks more often led to a shorter cooking time and a smaller gray band of dry, overcooked meat just under the surface of the steaks. After testing different flipping techniques and heating levels, we found that flipping the steaks every 2 minutes and transitioning from medium-high to medium-low heat partway through cooking resulted in a perfectly browned, crisp crust and a juicy, evenly cooked interior every time.

### Ingredients

---:|
2 ||| (450g) boneless strip steaks, 4 cm thick, trimmed
||| Salt and pepper
4|tbsp|| Unsalted Butter, softened
2|tbsp|| minced shallots
1|tbsp|| minced fresh parsley
1|tbsp|| minced fresh chives
1 |||garlic clove, minced
2|tbsp|| Vegetable Oil

### Method
*Don’t forget to take the butter out to soften at least 30 minutes before you start to cook.*

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place 12-inch cast-iron skillet on rack, and heat oven to 260°C. 
2. Season steaks with salt and let sit at room temperature. 
3. Combine butter, shallot, parsley, chives, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl; set aside.
2. When oven reaches 260°C, pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Using potholders, remove skillet from oven and place over medium-high heat; turn off oven. Being careful of hot skillet handle, add oil and heat until just smoking. 
3. Cook steaks, without moving them, until lightly browned on first side, about 2 minutes. Flip steaks and cook until lightly browned on second side, about 2 minutes.
3. Flip steaks, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until steaks are well browned and meat registers 49°C to 52°C (for medium-rare), 7 to 9 minutes. 
4. Transfer steaks to carving board, dollop 2 tablespoons herb butter on each steak, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice steaks 1.25cm thick and serve.
