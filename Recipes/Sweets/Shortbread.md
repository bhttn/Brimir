## Shortbread

The secret to these biscuits is replacing some of the butter with olive oil. It gives a lighter, crisper texture and a different flavour. And there are many variations, too (see below).

It’s important that the flour is added to the fat before the liquids, to stop the gluten in the flour from developing too much and making the dough tough rather than crumbly.

### Ingredients

*Makes approx. 20 biscuits*

|       |                                          |
| ----: | ---------------------------------------- |
|  175g | Plain flour                              |
| ½ tsp | Baking powder                            |
| ½ tsp | Salt                                     |
|  110g | Cold unsalted butter, cubed              |
|  100g | Unrefined caster sugar                   |
|   40g | Egg yolks, beaten (approx. 2 large egg yolks) |
|   35g | Olive oil                                |
|       | White caster sugar, for dusting          |


### Method

1. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl and set to one side.
2. Using a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, being careful not to over mix (approximately 5 minutes)
3. Reduce the speed of the mixer resembles fine breadcrumbs.
4. Combine the egg yolks and olive oil and add them gradually to the bowl while mixing until all the liquid has been incorporated and a soft dough has formed.
5. Mould the dough into a flat rectangle and wrap it in clingfilm. Place in the fridge to rest for atleast 2 hours.
6. After 2 hours, place the dough between two pieces of baking parchment and roll out into a rectangle of approximately 5mm in thickness. Cut the parchment and dough to fit a tray measuring 30 x 20 cm. Place the tray in the freezer for atleast 20 minutes.
7. Pre-heat the oven to 150°C
8. Remove the top layer of baking parchment and place the tray in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes. Turn the tray round and continue baking for a further 3 - 5 minutes until the dough is lightly golden all over.
9. While still warm, using a palette knife, slide the baked biscuit on to a chopping board and, using a sharp knife, cut into rectangles (approximately 3 x 5 cm). Sprinkle with the caster sugar and allow to cool.

The biscuits will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight tin.
